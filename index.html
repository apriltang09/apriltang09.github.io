	<h1>Hello World!</h1>

	<div>
		<p>Hello! My name is April and I am currently studying web development at Dev Bootcamp.</p>
	</div>
	<h2>My Coding Journey</h2>
	<div>
		<p>I started learning how to code because I was curious about the tech industry. People seem to have a lot of fun at work. They were making a positive impact in the world. I had a lot of free time and wanted to explore something that was challenging and would help me grow as a person. I saw programming as a way for me to express my creativity and to learn a valuable skill that could someday be used to help someone.</p>
	</div>
	<h2>The Basics</h2>
	<div>
		<p>I enjoy learning and exploring culture through food. I browse food isles and farmer's markets to learn about new products and inventions in the food industry. Usually, I prepare simple. healthy meals that are budget friendly. I try to use fresh, organic ingredients as much as possible.</p>
		<p>I try to include a good amount of physical activity on a daily basis. Right now, I am trying to get 10,000 steps a day. That's almost 5 miles! Sometimes, I go to the gym but I like hiking outdoors because of the beautiful scenery and the wind in your face!</p>
	</div>
	<h2>Current Favorites</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Halo Top ice cream</li>
		<li>early morning walks</li>
		<li>learning code</li>
		<li><a href="http://thechainsmokers.com/">The Chainsmokers</a>:
		The Chainsmokers website has a lot going on. There is a lot of div tags that give the page semantic meaning and it is heavy with CSS that styles the page. I notice there are also comments which viewers who visit the site cannot see but the developer working on the code can.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>My Cat</h2>
	<div>
		<p>My tabby cat Betsie has by my side since the good old college days. She knows me better than anyone else. Although she is finicky and as independent as they come, I can always rely on her to be there when I need her to be.</p>
