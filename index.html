	<h2 class="colored-block">My Coding Journey</h2>
		<p>I started learning to code because I was curious about the tech industry. People seem to have a lot of fun while also contributing positively to society. I had a lot of free time and wanted to learn something that was challenging and would help me grow as a person. I saw programming as a way for me to express my creativity and to learn a valuable skill that could someday help someone.</p>

	<h2 class="colored-block">The Basics</h2>
		<p>I enjoy learning and exploring culture through food. To learn about new products and inventions in the food industry, I like to browse food isles and farmer's markets. Usually, I prepare simple, healthy meals that is also budget friendly. I use fresh, organic ingredients whenever possible.</p>
		<p>I try to include a good amount of physical activity on a daily basis. Right now, I am trying to get 10,000 steps a day. That's almost 5 miles! Sometimes, I go to the gym but I like hiking outdoors because of the beautiful scenery and the wind in my face!</p>

		<li> <a href="http://thechainsmokers.com/">The Chainsmokers</a> The Chainsmokers website has a lot going on. There is a lot of div tags that give the page semantic meaning and it is heavy with CSS that styles the page. I notice there are also comments which viewers who visit the site cannot see but the developer working on the code can.</li>
