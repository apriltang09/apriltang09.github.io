		<p>Greetings and welcome to my webpage! My name is April and I am currently studying web development at DevBootcamp in San Francisco.</p>

	<h2>My Coding Journey</h2>
	<div>
		<p>I first started learning how to code partly out of boredom and partly out of curiosity. I wanted to learn something that was challenging and would help me grow as a person. I saw programming as a way for me to express my creativity while learning a valulable skill.</p>
	</div>
	<h2>The Basics</h2>
	<div>
		<p>Besides coding, I enjoy living a healthy lifestyle. This includes getting plenty of exercise by jogging around the city or hitting the gym and getting the miles in. I also like to eat whole foods and prepare meals based mostly on the Mediterranean diet.</p>
	</div>
	<h2>Current Favorites</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Halo Top ice cream</li>
		<li>early morning walks</li>
		<li>learning code</li>
		<li>The Chainsmokers</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>My Cat</h2>
	<div>
		<p>My tabby cat Betsie has by my side since the good old college days. She knows me better than anyone else. Although she is finicky and as independent as they come, I can always rely on her to be there when I need her to be.</p>
