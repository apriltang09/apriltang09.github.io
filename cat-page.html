	<h2>Playtime</h2>
	<div>
		<p>Betsie is her name and playing is her game! Betsie is a fiesty tabby with an independent streak and a mind of her own. She likes to unroll yarn, pitter pattering around the living room floor. She also likes to speak to flies and try to swat them with her tenny tiny paws. Although she has yet to successfully capture those little buggers, that doesn't stop her from trying! </p>
	</div>
	<h2>Naptime</h2>
	<div>
		<p>Besides playing, Betsie's second favorite activity is napping. On top of her cat house, on top of the refrigerator. Basically, anywhere high up so that she can reign over the house and make sure everyone is in line! She also likes sunny spots so on the window ceil is where you'll find her on a hot summer's day.</p>
